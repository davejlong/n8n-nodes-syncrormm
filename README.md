# n8n-nodes-syncrormm

*Warning: This node is still in very early development and is not expected to be very functional yet.*

An n8n community node to work with the Syncro RMM API within n8n workflows.


## Installation

Install the node by following [n8n's community node documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

## Why not the built-in node?

The SyncroMSP node built into n8n is extremely limited and buggy and this node is intended to be a complete rewrite. Once it's built out more, I will likely submit it to replace the SyncroMSP built-in node, but for now, I'm keeping it separate to ease the update process.

## Funding

If this community node helps you, please consider funding it's continued development.
