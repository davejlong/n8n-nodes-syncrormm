## Why not the built-in node?

The SyncroMSP node built into n8n is extremely limited and buggy and this node is intended to be a complete rewrite. Once it's built out more, I will likely submit it to replace the SyncroMSP built-in node, but for now, I'm keeping it separate to ease the update process.

## Funding

If this community node helps you, please consider funding it's continued development.
